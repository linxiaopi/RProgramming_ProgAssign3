# RProgramming_ProgAssign3
Week 4. Programming Assignment 3

Three functions/files for the programming assignment in week 4 of "R Programming" course on Coursera.org

Although it wasn't specified that it needed to be submitted, I've also included the plot of 30-day mortality rates for heart attacks (Item 1 in the "Programming Assignment 3" PDF). I included two PNG files (sized differently) and a PDF file of the same plot.
